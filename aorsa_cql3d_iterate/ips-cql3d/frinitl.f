c     'rect' : rectangular
c     'rect-lps':  rect. long pulse source (DIII-D only)
c     a choice of short or long pulse sources is
c     available by injector (not by source).  on
c     or both injectors may be long pulse by
c     setting one or both to 'rect-lps'
c     CAUTION:  DIII-D sources are defaulted to lps specs.
c     It is the user's responsibility to overide these for
c     sps configuration(s).
c     bheigh(ib)      Height of source (cm)
c     Default is bshape(1)=bshape(2)='rect-lps'

c
c     hdepsmth        set this parm to a positive value (gt.0.0) to turn of
c     the smoothing of hibrz and hdepz in sub postnub.
c     If this option is used then enough zones must be spec
c     for adequate resolution (zones=number of radial grid
c     and enough injected neutrals must be followed to minimize
c     the statistical noise enough so that no greatly uneven
c     profiles result! this option was added because the smoothing
c     of the profiles by subroutine smooth can lead to unphysical
c     forms of the birth and deposition profiles.
